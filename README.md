## My process

As mentioned in the style-guide I first started with the HTML structure of the solution, then the CSS/SASS coding. For the SASS code I used a very simple structure which consists in 4 files: base, components, layouts and main.

- base: contains resets, variables, mixins and utility classes.
- components: resuable classes.
- layout: the CSS that handles the layout, the main structure.
- main: contain the imports for all the files.

Also I used normalize.css for handling all the resets and avoid typical problems with browsers compatibility.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Normalize.css

### Useful resources

- [Structuring your sass projects](https://itnext.io/structuring-your-sass-projects-c8d41fa55ed4) - This helped me choosing the right file structure project for SASS.
- [MDN Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Always helpful when needing to understand how something works.
- [Coolors](https://coolors.co/e0e8ff-3829e0-f5f7ff-7280a7-1f2f56) - Great to see the entire pallet of colors and save it for later.
